Features
Beautiful, minimalistic and lightweight interface. Loop has an elegant and minimalistic interface that is very easy to use, even for first-time users. Highly optimized for speed, the app works well even on older phones.

Habit score. Loop has an advanced formula for calculating the strength of your habits. Every repetition makes your habit stronger and every missed day makes it weaker. A few missed days after a long streak, however, will not completely destroy your progress, unlike many other don't-break-the-chain apps.

Flexible schedules. In addition to daily habits, Loop supports habits with more complex schedules, such as 3 times per week or every other day.

Reminders. Schedule notifications to remind you of your habits. Each habit can have its own reminder, at a chosen time of the day. Easily check or dismiss your habit directly from the notification.

Widgets. Be reminded of your habits whenever you unlock your phone. Colorful widgets allow you to track your habits directly from your home screen, without even opening the app.
